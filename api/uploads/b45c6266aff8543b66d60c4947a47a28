B07W7CTLD1,Mamaearth-Onion-Growth-Control-Redensyl,9/6/2019,1,I bought this hair oil after viewing so many good comments. But this product is not good enough.First of all it's Expensive...Second thing the amount of the product is low (half bottle) YES!The bottle is not completely filled with oil. If you cheating on your customers #Mamaearth trust me on this you can't fool people more than once. Now I know that your Brand is not good enough. I am not going to buy any product from your Brand again.Thumbs down for mamaearth onion oil !!
B07W7CTLD1,Mamaearth-Onion-Growth-Control-Redensyl,8/14/2019,5,"Used This Mama Earth Newly Launched Onion Oil twice, and i must say im already impressed by the results !It prevents hair loss, helps control premature greying, dryness, dandruff, scalp eruptions and many other hair problems after its regular use !To avoid dry and frizzy hair, make sure that you use this oil to your hairs twice a week.Oiling provides your scalp with essential nutrients, and also strengthens the hair roots. Mamaearth onion oil works best for your hair during all the seasons."

B07W7CTLD1,Mamaearth-Onion-Growth-Control-Redensyl,9/16/2019,1,Product just smells similar to navarathna hair oil .. but not strong as that and oil is not sticky after applying three drops of oil !! More review after usage of 2 months1) worst product2) hair fall increased a lot3) brought this product after watching YouTube influencer Mumbaiker Nikhil4) totally misguided never take suggestions from influencers.5) using since 2 months no result and I'm losing my more hair6) mama earth just wasted my money as well damaged my hair7)better they provide solution or return my money
B07W7CTLD1,Mamaearth-Onion-Growth-Control-Redensyl,8/18/2019,5,I have been trying different onion oil for my hair as my hair is not very healthy. This product has literally changed the texture of my scalp and I am really happy with the results. It comes in a nice colorful packaging too. Definitely recommend this one to everyone looking out for onion oil. For more reviews you can follow me on Instagram @insi_lovemyself.
B07W7CTLD1,Mamaearth-Onion-Growth-Control-Redensyl,9/30/2019,4,"I have been using this product for some time now. My Roommate had this and I had been planning to order for a while now. I just used to forget all the time, finally I have it now.Well from the last 2 months of use, here's my experience with the product:I use it every night and get a shower in the morning.Pros:1. The oil is non greasy, and pretty light.2. Has very good smell.no pungent or awkward fragrance3. My hair doesn't lump in together as with other hair oil products.4.Gives a pretty good shine and dark color5. It's very helpful for dandruff, hairfall/ hairloss. I don't have a very dense hair presence so my scalp was visible all the time, Now it looks pretty dense.Cons.1 .can't find anything at allI do recommend it for people having hairfall issues."
B07W7CTLD1,Mamaearth-Onion-Growth-Control-Redensyl,9/28/2019,1,I purchased both oil and shampoo after watching fake YouTube and customer review.After first day of use of oil and shampoo my hairfall increased.
B07W7CTLD1,Mamaearth-Onion-Growth-Control-Redensyl,8/20/2019,5,It's a very good product from mamaearth. The oil gives your hair full strength and perfect shine. Onion are rich in sulphur thats add up the strength of hair roots and holds the hair preventing hairloss. Suitable for all type hair. For better result use at night. Go for it.
B07W7CTLD1,Mamaearth-Onion-Growth-Control-Redensyl,11/15/2019,3,"Why are you showing onion oil benefits in your ad , when you ate not giving onion oil in your product. I bought this for redensyl content ...but not sure about the percentage of it bein added. Secondly it only has onion extracts, which am sure not is effective.Switchin back to my conventional method of makin onion juice and applyin on scalp"
B07W7CTLD1,Mamaearth-Onion-Growth-Control-Redensyl,8/30/2019,5,I used it only one time so I can't say about hairfall control but I couldn't stop myself to mention about its amazing effect. It made my hair extremely soft and shiny which was visible properly. Smell was strong but not bothering. I think this is the best hair fall which I have used till date. My search ends over here I suppose. Just waiting to see its impact on arresting hairfall.

B07BGT4J55,Mamaearth-Percent-Natural-Berry-Toothpaste,6/16/2018,5,Nice one... My 2.5 yr old son likes to brush with this flavour- strawberry. Previously I used to use Chicco but switched to this one due to good reviews and lower price.I had used Mee Mee also but this one's ingredients are better for my child's health.
B07BGT4J55,Mamaearth-Percent-Natural-Berry-Toothpaste,9/24/2018,1,"My 2 year old child doesn't have cavity but started developing bad breaths the morning after, while using this toothpaste for a couple of weeks during day and night brushing sessions. I feel this toothpaste might actually cause cavity rather than keep it away, from my experience. I immediately shifted back to Pigeon toothpaste for night brushing and the bad breath stopped from the next day onward. I had purchased it for its all natural properties. Mama Earth team needs to research more on the ingredients on this product. I use other Mama Earth products and they are decent. Not this toothpaste though."
B07BGT4J55,Mamaearth-Percent-Natural-Berry-Toothpaste,10/18/2018,5,"Berry flavoured blast that the kids just love! And the best part is that its perfectly fine if they swallow it too! Made with 100% safe ingredients, this should be the toothpaste you should introduce your kids to! Mamaearth Berry Blast toothpaste is 100% safe and toxin free. My kids love the Berry taste while brushing. This is one of the best flouride free tooth pastes available for kids that you should be buying right away!"
B07BGT4J55,Mamaearth-Percent-Natural-Berry-Toothpaste,11/15/2018,5,Well how much a 12 month old with 4 almost 5 teeth brushes. But this product is good to start eating or tasting rather by baby. that way it is natural and taste good. i applied bit on her teeth thn forgot where i kept it.Buy for your own satisfaction if baby is really small and if understands how to brush and spit or eat than go for it.

Claims to be plastic responsible.Cons:None that I found in the last few months.Verdict:Recommended toothpaste for kids above 1 year. My son likes it. The strawberry flavour is quite noticeable when you're brushing your kid.

B07BGT4J55,Mamaearth-Percent-Natural-Berry-Toothpaste,7/9/2018,5,Very good product. Reliable and very good quality. My child (4YO) loves it. Earlier he was using Chicco toothpaste. Now loving it. Mamaearth is at par with Chicco in quality yet way economical.

B07BGT4J55,Mamaearth-Percent-Natural-Berry-Toothpaste,8/18/2018,5,The taste is a bit like mild flavoured bubble gum.... My 2 yr old likes it. Plus it claims to be safe for kids since it is all natural without flouride and SLS (chemical used for foaming).Wish that the quantity was a bit more
B07BGT4J55,Mamaearth-Percent-Natural-Berry-Toothpaste,12/6/2018,5,It is completely natural so I feel safe for my son. Before I used dento shine tooth paste. But this has changed a lott. Just go for it . It safe.

B082NWX7JC,Mamaearth-Natural-Turmeric-Saffron-brightning,8/6/2018,5,I bought this because I was super impressed with the ingredients list. This one says it's a skin-lighting face wash which I felt so disappointed about at first but then I realised it makes your skin lighter by removing tan from your face. I am really very impressed with the effects. It leaves my skin squeaky clean and makes it brighter. I really love the fragrance of this face wash.
B082NWX7JC,Mamaearth-Natural-Turmeric-Saffron-brightning,1/30/2019,1,It's thick.It has beads and I don't know why they want me to scrub my face off everyday !!!It doesn't foam like a facewash.It smells like pulpy orange while applying and then smells a bit like turmeric after washing off.My face looked bright after using it but not as bright as my previous facewashes.Made my skin dry. It was annoying since my skin was already dry without it and it made it worse !It is definitely not worth the money ( I got it for 175rs in a sale. Still isn't worth it )I don't think it worked on my tan. I still dont see any changes in skin.It's disappointing !!!!
B082NWX7JC,Mamaearth-Natural-Turmeric-Saffron-brightning,10/15/2018,5,"So this is one such facewash free from parabens and sulfate, hence made me order it. Talking about the natural ingredients like turmeric and liquorice extract attracted it more. The consistency of this facewash is bit thick like a scrub making it unusual for others but I loved it as it makes your skin clean and radiant. Best for people who wants to get rid of tanning, discoloration and pigmentation."

B082NWX7JC,Mamaearth-Natural-Turmeric-Saffron-brightning,4/15/2019,5,"Had tried this product majorly because of the name and ingredients that it has. For the first time a company is able to get the product that is based on our ancient secret recipes of our Dadi Nani... a person like me who has super dry skin, this is the perfect product for me as it hydrates my skin thoroughly and gives an instant freshness like the way ubtan gives.

B082NWX7JC,Mamaearth-Natural-Turmeric-Saffron-brightning,8/8/2018,5,Ubtan Facewash- made from Turmeric and Liqurice Extract. Was excited to use as heard first time about facewash of Ubtan. Helps in removing dead cells and gives a glow on skin. Very helpful product to repair sun damage and tan and to protect your skin from tanning.

Liquorice helps repair the sun damage caused by exposure to the harsh rays of the sun. Turmeric light the skin tone and improves the skin complection.It's one of the best face wash. Smells also very nice."
B082NWX7JC,Mamaearth-Natural-Turmeric-Saffron-brightning,8/6/2018,5,I bought this because I was super impressed with the ingredients list. This one says it's a skin-lighting face wash which I felt so disappointed about at first but then I realised it makes your skin lighter by removing tan from your face. I am really very impressed with the effects. It leaves my skin squeaky clean and makes it brighter. I really love the fragrance of this face wash.
B082NWX7JC,Mamaearth-Natural-Turmeric-Saffron-brightning,1/30/2019,1,It's thick.It has beads and I don't know why they want me to scrub my face off everyday !!!It doesn't foam like a facewash.It smells like pulpy orange while applying and then smells a bit like turmeric after washing off.My face looked bright after using it but not as bright as my previous facewashes.Made my skin dry. It was annoying since my skin was already dry without it and it made it worse !It is definitely not worth the money ( I got it for 175rs in a sale. Still isn't worth it )I don't think it worked on my tan. I still dont see any changes in skin.It's disappointing !!!!
B082NWX7JC,Mamaearth-Natural-Turmeric-Saffron-brightning,10/15/2018,5,"So this is one such facewash free from parabens and sulfate, hence made me order it. Talking about the natural ingredients like turmeric and liquorice extract attracted it more. The consistency of this facewash is bit thick like a scrub making it unusual for others but I loved it as it makes your skin clean and radiant. Best for people who wants to get rid of tanning, discoloration and pigmentation."
